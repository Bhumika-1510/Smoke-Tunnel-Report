# Scaled Smoke Tunnel for Airfoil Flow Visualization

## Description
This project involves the design and fabrication of a compact, low-cost tabletop smoke tunnel to visualize airflow over airfoil models. The setup allows real-time observation of laminar and turbulent flow using smoke streaklines, making fundamental aerodynamic concepts easier to understand through hands-on experimentation.

The tunnel was designed using CAD software and constructed using simple, easily available materials such as plywood, acrylic sheets, a low-speed fan, and an incense-based smoke source. It provides an affordable and portable alternative to conventional wind tunnels and is suitable for classroom demonstrations, laboratory experiments, and basic fluid mechanics studies.
